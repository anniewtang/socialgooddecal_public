    "In this assignment, we will be using k-nearest neighbors to learn about sentencing in Iowa Prisons. We will be using two datasets: the labeled dataset, which has information about the individual's age, race, institution, offense, and months served, and the testing dataset, which has all of that information except the individual's months served in prison. We will then use k-nearest-neighbors to predict sentencing for everyone in the testing dataset."

    "First, we'll load in the labeled dataset. Note that the fiscal year and age at closure are not whole numbers- we've normalized the column so that they are treated with as much weightage as any other column. Most other categories have been encoded using one-hot encoding, which creates columns for each unique value and places a 1 in that column if that instance fits that category. Note that for the race category, there is a 2 in the column if the individual is of that race. We have done that to place more weightage on the race category when using our k-nearest neighbors algorithm."
